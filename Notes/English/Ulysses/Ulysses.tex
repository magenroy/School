		Joyce's Intent was that every chapter, every hour of the day,

		whole to condition and even create its own technique \\
		Races
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Dedalus is Irish.
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Represents Ireland.
						\item Considered with his Irish identity
						(British colonialization,
						Italian Pope).

						metaphor for artist)
					\end{itemize}
				\item Bloom is Jewish. 
					\begin{itemize}

	\section{How critics have approached it}
		\subsection{As a Novel}
			Very realistic, lots of information \\
			Learn far more about the characters than ever before \\
			Highly developped characters \\
			Main things that happen
				\begin{itemize}
					\item funeral of Patty Dignam
					\item birth of Master Mortimer Edward Purefoy
					\item Molly's adultery on Bloom's bed
					\item Dedalus and Bloom finally meet and share a
					cup of
				\end{itemize}
			For the first time, getting extremely interior monologue,
			attempts to directly mimic people's thoughts, which is not
			always poetic and pretty stuff.
		
		\subsection{As a Symbolic System}
			Employes structure of the Odyssey
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Telemachai sections 1-3
					\item The Odyssey sections 4-15
					\item Nostos sections 16-18
				\end{enumerate}
			Each section is given a heading from the Odyssey \\
			The sections aren't necessarily in chronological order\\
			Each character is related with a character in Odyssey
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Dedalus is Telemachus
					\item Bloom is Ulysses
					\item Molly is Penelope
					\item Buck is head suitor
					\item Barmaids are sirens
					\itme Bella is Cerces
				\end{itemize}
			asdf
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Scylla (the rock) represents dogma
					\item Charybdis (the whirlpool) is
					mysticism
					\item Helios' sacred oxen related to
					fertility
				\end{itemize}
			Each episode has its own thingies

		\subsection{Text or Metatext}
			(text is) Very self-aware \\
			Joyce constantly draws attention to fact that this is
			artifact constructed out of words, symbols,
			correspondences and kasdfj \\
			Purpose is for readers to enjoy the complexity \\
			No willing suspension of disbelief, instead constantly
			and to comment on this as text and stuff
